                <h5 class="common-paragraph">There is room for non-technical people as well. Görli Testnet is a collective of individuals that believe that agnostic collaboration and coordination can be realistically achieved, and that tribalism can be dissolved and that community is what matters the most. <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#goerli:matrix.parity.io">Join our Riot</a>. </h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">We also need funds. We want to pay our contributors.

                <h5 class="common-paragraph">Görli Testnet is a community-built PoA cross-client testnet. The first one of its kind. So it’s only natural that the first testnet conference would be centred around it.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">What will it involve?<br>
                There will be hands-on sessions, presentations, and a discussion on how to support OS contributors. Görli, as any other community OS project, faces funding difficulties. We don’t believe in free work. We need to be fair and pay the contributors, and build a healthy and sustainable community. </h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">The project has great potential to alleviate the current testnets that exist in the space, and give dApp developers from both the ETH and ETC ecosystem, the possibility to have a more robust testnet, one able to adapt to their needs, to work with, and we want to make that happen.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">Tech and non-tech people are welcome to join. Especially if you consider yourself an Open-Source advocate. No previous experience needed, as we’ll have an onboarding session at the start of the day.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">In addition, as Görli Testnet was born at ETHBerlin, we want to throw a reunion for the hackathon. If you were a hacker, a sponsor, or a fan, please get in touch for our show & tell session.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">About your Kickback contribution: as mentioned, Görli Testnet is facing funding difficulties. We are setting up a 45 EUR deposit to come to the event. As in Kickback’s usual fashion, you can either choose to claim it back, or donate to the project -  this is entirely up to you and no fingers will be pointed. All proceeds will go to funding Görli Testnet.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">The event includes food and drinks - this is hosted & funded by the Department of Decentralization, the artists formerly known as ETHBerlin.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">We look forward to everyone joining, and if you have ideas, well, we got a form and eager to hear from you!</h5>
