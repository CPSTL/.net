                <h5 class="common-paragraph">G&ouml;rli Testnet is a community-built proof-of-authority cross-client testnet. The first one of its kind. So it’s only natural that the first testnet conference would be centred around it, where it was born, in Berlin.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">What will it involve? There will be hands-on sessions, presentations, and a discussion on how to support open-source contributors.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">The project has great potential to alleviate the current testnets that exist in the space, and give dApp developers from both the ETH and ETC ecosystem, the possibility to have a more robust testnet, one able to adapt to their needs, to work with, and we want to make that happen.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">Tech and non-tech people are welcome to join the one-day conference. Especially if you consider yourself an open-source advocate. No previous experience needed, as we’ll have an onboarding session at the start of the day.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">In addition, as G&ouml;rli Testnet was born at ETHBerlin, we want to throw a reunion for the hackathon. If you were a hacker, a sponsor, or a fan, please get in touch for our show & tell session.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">About your Kickback contribution: We are setting up a 45 EUR deposit to come to the event. As in Kickback’s usual fashion, you can either choose to claim it back once you arrive, or donate to the project - this is entirely up to you and no fingers will be pointed. All proceeds will go to funding G&ouml;rli Testnet.</h5>
                <h5 class="common-paragraph">The event includes food and drinks - this is hosted & funded by the Department of Decentralization, the artists formerly known as ETHBerlin. We look forward to everyone joining, and if you have ideas, well, we got a form and eager to hear from you!</h5>
